This project presents a system for remotely and automatically control electrical devices.
A device can be powered on/off in accordance with a given schedule, without manual operations, which is advantageous in cases of many devices and of devices hardly accessible.
A working prototype of the system has been built, which consists of a device controller and a WWW application.
The controller is an electronic circuit whose main parts are a relay switch and a microcontroller with WiFi connectivity.
It has been created by adding extra hardware to the ESP8266 WiFi module, and by designing a customized software by using the C language  and the Non-OS SDK (software development kit).
The application allows for intuitively managing controllers and schedules via web browser.
It has been developed using the JavaScript language, Node.js runtime environment, PostgreSQL database, and Sequelize ORM framework.
